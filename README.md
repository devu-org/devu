# Devu — The Open-Source Developer University

**No tutorials. No shortcuts. Build real projects, submit your work, and get peer-reviewed.**

## About Devu

Devu is an open-source, project-based learning platform designed to teach developers **real-world skills**. Unlike traditional tutorials or CS degrees that focus on theory, Devu focuses on **hands-on projects**, **peer feedback**, and **practical engineering experience**.  

Our mission is to build **real developers, not vibe coders**.

## How Devu Works

1. **Tracks**  
   Devu organizes learning into tracks (e.g., Backend Engineering, Frontend Engineering, Low-Level Systems). Each track contains multiple real-world projects.

2. **Projects**  
   Every project comes with:  
   - `README.md` — the assignment and goals  
   - `starter/` — starter code  
   - `tests/` — automated tests for validation  
   - `solutions/` — reference solution (optional)  
   - `devu.json` — metadata for the CLI

3. **CLI: Devu Student Portal**  
   The Devu CLI allows students to:  
   - Copy starter code into their workspace  
   - Run tests to validate their work  
   - Submit their project via a GitHub Pull Request  

4. **Peer Review**  
   Submissions are visible as PRs in the Devu repository. Contributors review and leave feedback, helping everyone improve.
